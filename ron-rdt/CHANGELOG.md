## [0.12] - 2022-03-11
- Added `Editable` typeclass which generalizes RON.Data.RGA.edit

## [0.10] - 2019-10-08
### Added
- `RGA.toList`
- `RGA.toText`

## [0.9] - 2019-09-06
### Added
- Function `ORSet.getFieldObject`
- Export `ORSetRep` constructor
- Extend error reporting
- `ORSet.removeObjectIf`
- `ORSet.addFieldValue`
- `ORSet.removeFieldValue`
- `ORSet.removeFieldValueIf`

### Changed
- Renamed `getObject` to `readObject`

## [0.8] - 2019-08-10
### Added
- Function `reduceState`
- Function `reduceObjectStates`
- Checking type field and correcting object reduce
- Function `stateFromWireChunk`
- Function `stateToWireChunk`

### Changed
- `Reducible` depends on `BoundedSemilattice`.
- `ReplicatedAsObject` depends on `ReplicatedBoundedSemilattice`.
- `ReplicatedAsObject`:
  - Removed method `objectOpType`
  - Added associated type alias `Rep` --
    untyped RON-RDT representation of a typed RDT.
  - Behavior: referencing `Rep` type instead of duplicating type UUID
- `Option` encoding: for availability, anything except `some` means None.
  None is encoded as empty payload.
- Renamed `ORSet.zoom` -> `zoomItem`.
- Renamed `LWW.newObject` -> `newStruct`.
- Event simulation: decreased max event leap from 2³² to 2¹⁶
- Text serialization: changed chunk sort order from (type, id) to just id
- ORSet: keep payload on removal
- LWW
  - fields are always optional
  - `viewField` returns `Maybe`
  - `readField` returns `Maybe`
  - `assignField` takes `Maybe`

### Fixed
- Causality: an object happens-before its ops (in ORSet, RGA, LWW)
- Tombstone creation in ORSet

### Removed
- Function `mkStateChunk`.
- RON type `Option` (instances for Haskell type `Maybe`)
- Class `ReplicatedBoundedSemilattice`
- Function `objectRconcat` (`rconcat` took its place)

## [0.7] - 2019-07-26
### Added
- `newObjectState`
- `ObjectState` "monad":
  - `ObjectStateT`, `MonadObjectState`
  - `evalObjectState`
  - `evalObjectState_`
  - `execObjectState`
  - `execObjectState_`
  - `newObjectState`
  - `newObjectStateWith`
  - `runObjectState`
  - `runObjectState_`
- `ORSet`:
  - Instances `Eq`, `Show` for `ORSet`.
  - `ORSetItem` type.
  - Methods `findAnyAlive`, `findAnyAlive'`, `zoom`.
- `ORSetMap` type.

### Changed
- `ReplicatedAsObject.newObject` now has more specific type,
  and implementation doesn't need to call `collectFrame`.
- Method `ReplicatedAsObject.newObject` is now a function `newObject` with the
  same type.
- Now `ObjectState` keeps a typed reference to an object with state frame
  attached,
  and `Object` is just a type UUID --
  a typed reference to an object in a state frame passed in
  `MonadObjectState` context.
  Object is now passed as an explicit argument.
- `ORSet` now can contain objects.
- `ORSet.addValue` now accepts objects.
- Renamed `LwwPerField` to `LwwRep`.
- Renamed `RgaRaw` to `RgaRep`.
- Renamed `ORSetRaw` to `ORSetRep`.

### Removed
- `ObjectORSet` merged into `ORSet`.
- `ORSet.addNewRef` merged into `addValue`.

## [0.6] - 2019-04-25
### Added
- `RON.Data.RGA`:
  - `getAliveIndices`
  - `insert`
  - `insertAfter`
  - `insertAtBegin`
  - `insertText`
  - `insertTextAfter`
  - `insertTextAtBegin`
  - `remove`

## [0.5] - 2019-02-04
### Added
- `RON.UUID.liftName` function to create name UUIDs in compile time.
- `RON.Util.ByteStringL` type.
- `RON.Error` module with unified pretty errors.
- Organize `Replicated`, `ReplicatedAsPayload`, and `ReplicatedAsObject` in
  class hierarchy.
- Add `ORSet.removeValue` and `removeRef` implementation.
- Op "patterns" and patterns.

### Removed
- Type alias `ObjectId` since objects are identified by UUID.

### Changed
- Extracted `ron-storage` package.
- Extracted `ron-schema` package.
- Extracted `ron-rdt` package.
- Switched from `Either String a` to `MonadError String m => m a` in failable
  procedures.
- `ORSet.addRef` now adds item's frame, too.
- `ORSet.addNewRef` now returns the reference to the freshly created object.
- Change `StateFrame` key to UUID since objects are identified by UUID.
- Renamed `RawOp` to `ClosedOp` according to the fresh spec.

### Fixed

## [0.4] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Schema `enum` declaration.
- `docIdFromUuid`.
- `OnDocumentChanged` is called each time when any document is changed.

### Changed

  specification.
- RGA: sequential UUIDs on initialization.
- Optimized `Base64.isLetter`.
- Extend `UUID.mkName` to accept any monad.
- Renamed `MonadStorage` methods `list...` -> `get...`
- Renamed `RON.Storage.saveDocument` -> `createDocument`

### Removed
- `RON.Storage.uuidToFileName` as it has no sense as an abstraction
- `RON.Storage.IO.runStorageT` with `StorageT`

## [0.1] - 2018-11-08
