## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `newObjectState`
- `ObjectState` "monad":
  - `ObjectStateT`, `MonadObjectState`
  - `evalObjectState`
  - `evalObjectState_`
  - `execObjectState`
  - `execObjectState_`
  - `newObjectState`
  - `newObjectStateWith`
  - `runObjectState`
  - `runObjectState_`
- Instances `Eq`, `Show` for `ORSet`.

### Changed
- `ReplicatedAsObject.newObject` now has more specific type,
  and implementation doesn't need to call `collectFrame`.
- Method `ReplicatedAsObject.newObject` is now a function `newObject` with the
  same type.
- Now `ObjectState` keeps a typed reference to an object with state frame
  attached,
  and `Object` is just a type UUID --
  a typed reference to an object in a state frame passed in
  `MonadObjectState` context.
  Object is now passed as an explicit argument.
- `ORSet` now can contain objects.
- `ORSet.addValue` now accepts objects.

### Removed
- `ObjectORSet` merged into `ORSet`.
- `ORSet.addNewRef` merged into `addValue`.

## [0.6] - 2019-04-25
### Added
- `RON.Data.RGA`:

  - `insertTextAtBegin`
  - `remove`

- `RON.Util.ByteStringL` type.
- `RON.Error` module with unified pretty errors.
- Organize `Replicated`, `ReplicatedAsPayload`, and `ReplicatedAsObject` in
  class hierarchy.
- Add `ORSet.removeValue` and `removeRef` implementation.
- Op "patterns" and patterns.

### Removed
- Type alias `ObjectId` since objects are identified by UUID.

### Changed
- Extracted `ron-storage` package.
- Extracted `ron-schema` package.
- Extracted `ron-rdt` package.
- Switched from `Either String a` to `MonadError String m => m a` in failable
  procedures.
- `ORSet.addRef` now adds item's frame, too.
- `ORSet.addNewRef` now returns the reference to the freshly created object.
- Change `StateFrame` key to UUID since objects are identified by UUID.

### Fixed
- Error handling in Boole decoder.

- Schema `enum` declaration.
- `docIdFromUuid`.
- `OnDocumentChanged` is called each time when any document is changed.

### Changed
- Made GHC 8.6 default.

### Removed
- Schema embedded DSL helpers: `atomInteger`, `atomString`, `boole`, `char`,
  `field`, `option`, `orSet`, `rgaString`, `structLww`, `versionVector`.

### Fixed
- `RGA.edit` bug with re-adding deleted items (#39).

## [0.3] - 2018-12-05
### Added
- Encode/decode EpochTime.

- Optimized `Base64.isLetter`.
- Extend `UUID.mkName` to accept any monad.
- Renamed `MonadStorage` methods `list...` -> `get...`
- Renamed `RON.Storage.saveDocument` -> `createDocument`

### Removed
- `RON.Storage.uuidToFileName` as it has no sense as an abstraction
- `RON.Storage.IO.runStorageT` with `StorageT`

## [0.1] - 2018-11-08
