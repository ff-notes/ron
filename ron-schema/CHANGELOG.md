## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Generate `struct_set.$(field)_zoom` for opaque object field
- Generate `struct_set.$(field)_get` for object field

### Changed
- `opaque atoms`  is now `opaque_atoms`
- `opaque object` is now `opaque_object`
- `struct_set.$(field)_assign` is split into:
  - `struct_set.$(field)_set` now accepts only "whole" (not Nothing) values
  - `struct_set.$(field)_clear` assigns Nothing
- Renamed `struct_lww.$(field)_assign` to `struct_lww.$(field)_set`

### Removed
- `TComposite`, now `TEnum _ :: RonType`

## [0.8] - 2019-08-10
### Added
- `Float` atom type
- `UUID` atom type
- Struct field annotations
- `struct_set` to define an ORSet-based structure

### Changed
- LWW
  - fields are always optional
  - `viewField` returns `Maybe`
  - `readField` returns `Maybe`
  - `assignField` takes `Maybe`

### Removed
- `Option` type

## [0.7] - 2019-07-26
### Added
- `alias` declaration.
- `ORSet.Map` type.

### Changed
- Renamed `Boole` -> `Bool` due to tradition.
- `ORSet` don't generate `ObjectORSet` wrapper since `ORSet` now manages
  objects too.
- Now `ObjectState` keeps a typed reference to an object with state frame
  attached,
  and `Object` is just a type UUID --
  a typed reference to an object in a state frame passed in
  `MonadObjectState` context.
  Object is now passed as an explicit argument.

### Removed
- Concept of view type. Maybe will return later.

## [0.6] - 2019-04-25
### Added
- Schema language: `RGA` type.

## [0.5] - 2019-02-04
### Added
- `RON.UUID.liftName` function to create name UUIDs in compile time.
- `RON.Util.ByteStringL` type.
- `RON.Error` module with unified pretty errors.
- Organize `Replicated`, `ReplicatedAsPayload`, and `ReplicatedAsObject` in
  class hierarchy.
- Add `ORSet.removeValue` and `removeRef` implementation.
- Op "patterns" and patterns.

### Removed
- Type alias `ObjectId` since objects are identified by UUID.

### Changed
- Extracted `ron-storage` package.
- Extracted `ron-schema` package.
- Extracted `ron-rdt` package.
- Switched from `Either String a` to `MonadError String m => m a` in failable
  procedures.
- `ORSet.addRef` now adds item's frame, too.
- `ORSet.addNewRef` now returns the reference to the freshly created object.
- Change `StateFrame` key to UUID since objects are identified by UUID.
- Renamed `RawOp` to `ClosedOp` according to the fresh spec.

### Fixed
- Error handling in Boole decoder.

## [0.4] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Schema `enum` declaration.
- `docIdFromUuid`.
- `OnDocumentChanged` is called each time when any document is changed.

### Changed
- Made GHC 8.6 default.

### Removed
- Schema embedded DSL helpers: `atomInteger`, `atomString`, `boole`, `char`,
  `field`, `option`, `orSet`, `rgaString`, `structLww`, `versionVector`.

### Fixed
- `RGA.edit` bug with re-adding deleted items (#39).

## [0.3] - 2018-12-05

- Renamed `MonadStorage` methods `list...` -> `get...`
